WebDev Project â€“ Nail Appointment Booking System  
For Summer Repeats Submission  

Overview  
This project is a simple PHP-based web application that allows users to view nail designs, sign up, log in, and book an appointment with a nail artist. It includes frontend and backend logic, user session handling, and database integration using PHP and MySQL.

Features Implemented  
- Homepage with previews of nail sets that link to individual pages  
- Individual nail pages (nail1.php, nail2.php, etc.) with sample layout  
- Static About page  
- User Sign-Up and Login pages  
- Appointment booking form that only appears once logged in

- Confirmation message after booking  
- Responsive design using Bootstrap and custom CSS
